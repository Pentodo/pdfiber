# PDFiber

**Status:** Under Development ðŸš§

## About

An API written in **Go** and built using the **Fiber framework**, inspired by tools like **iLovePDF**. The primary goal of this project is to serve as a way to enhance my skills in Go programming. It's not intended to be overly complex, but rather a practical and hands-on approach to learning and improving my development abilities while working with PDF file manipulation tasks.

Even though itâ€™s a learning project, PDFiber aims to provide useful features for handling PDF files with a focus on simplicity and efficiency.
